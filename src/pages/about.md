I used to be sinEagle, but now my name is Yorick. I have given up my previous Hexo blog and embraced Astro-paper. I will be sharing some Linux kernel-level technologies and my personal learning notes. Of course, it won't be limited to just thatâ€”I will also share everything related to computer science and programming.
