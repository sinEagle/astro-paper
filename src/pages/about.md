Hello, I am sinEagle.Yorick and Bottlecodes are also my names. I have given up my previous Hexo blog and embraced Astro-paper. I will be sharing some Linux kernel-level technologies and my personal learning notes. Of course, it won't be limited to just thatâ€”I will also share everything related to computer science and programming.

## Tech Stack

This theme is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents.
I would like to thank the community authors for providing such an efficient and beautiful [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) blog template.
